# Gravity-Ninja-Unity

Hyper casual game, originally created in Java, now ported to Unity with new features. 
Players have to avoid enemies that follow them around the game scene by employing movement abilities such as gravity flipping and dashing.
Players collect points by destroying enemies by shooting them with shuriken based on a point-and-click mechanic that operates on a cooldown.
